# Trend Micro IPS Filter Data Categorization (Summer 2020 Intern Project)

<br>

The summer following my Freshman year at UT, I was the first and only intern on the Digital Vaccine Labs (DVLabs) Cybersecurity Team at Trend Micro. For my main project, I categorized Trend Micro's existing 20,000+ Network Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) Filters by industry vertical and product type to create a personalized experience for every customer by using machine learning (ML), natural language processing (NLP), and Google's Knowledge Graph API. The purpose of my project was to decrease the number of filters activated for a customer using limited information (such as the customer’s industry and types of products used since they oftentimes do not know their entire tech stack) in order to improve IPS device resource dependencies which improves customer network speeds and overall security coverage. Additionally, as a side-project I discovered the need for, designed, and took ownership and leadership of, I corrected filter metadata using NLP and Python’s FuzzyWuzzy library, leading to activating filters that would have otherwise been deactivated due to typos in the metadata, which also resulted in better security coverage for customers. I designed this code to be reusable, so when the VP was impressed by my side project and wanted something similar to be done for the sales team to improve information reliability and team productivity, I was able to repeat the process to correct sales team data in under an hour. My day-to-day tasks involved writing and shipping dozens of network IPS filters to protect customers by researching, reproducing, and testing vulnerabilities with the help of the DVLabs and Zero Day Initiative (ZDI) teams.
